                With the idea of imparting programming
                knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT
                Roorkee alumnus started a dream,
                GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
                excites you or you feel stifled,
                wondering how to prepare for
                interview questions or
                how to ace data structures and
                algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a
                one-stop solution. With every
                tick of time, we are adding arrows
                in our quiver. From articles on
                various computer science subjects
                to programming problems for practice,
                from basic to premium courses, from
                technologies to entrance examinations,
                we have been building ample content
                with superior quality. In a short
                span, we have built a community of
                1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
                Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors
                in various colleges across the nation.
                Our success stories include a lot of
                students who benefitted in their
                placements and landed jobs at tech
                giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
                network of geeks and we are only a
                fraction of it yet.

          <h1>About The Programming Conference</h1>
    <h2>
        A programming organization is planning a contest for several programmers, each of which has a certain rating. (The higher the rating, the better the programmer.) Each programmer is paired with another programmer, and the difference between their ratings is referred to as the "bias amount". Given the ratings of all the programmers in the contest, what is the minimum total bias amount that can be achieved by optimally planning the programmer pairs.

Programming knowledge doesn't just benefit those who work in computer science or related fields. For example, people who work in marketing, design, sales and customer relations for technology products can use programming training to enhance their skill sets. Marketing requires data collection and analysis of customer demographics and sales trends to guide advertising strategies, and designers with programming skills can create digital advertisements. People who work in customer-facing positions can use their programming knowledge to assist with queries about technical issues
